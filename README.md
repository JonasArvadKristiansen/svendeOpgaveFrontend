# Setup frontend
To begin setup the frontend you need to install npm to use the diffrent packeges or libaries theres in inuse so use the command "npm install".

Then you need to create an config.json file for the path of the diffrent fetch request thats going to be called to the backend
the config.json file needs to be placed inside the src folder.  

But when running locally you can't login to Facebook or Google as a user.

Now you should be able to run the project without any problems with "npm run dev".

And if you need a build version you need to use "npm run build"
it will NOT build if anything exist but is not in use so either remove it or outcomment the code that not in use.
